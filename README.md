# AWS-Textract-S3-Lambda



🚀 Built an Automated Document Processing System with AWS

The Challenge:
Manual data entry from physical documents = 5 minutes per document
❌ Slow, error-prone, expensive

The Solution:
Event-driven serverless architecture ⚡

📊 How It Works:
1️⃣ Upload image → S3
2️⃣ S3 event triggers Lambda
3️⃣ AWS Textract extracts data (AI-powered)
4️⃣ Lambda parses to structured JSON
5️⃣ Dashboard displays image + editable fields

✨ Results:
- 5 seconds processing time
- 99%+ accuracy
- $0.002 per document
- Infinitely scalable

🛠️ Tech Stack:
AWS Lambda | Textract | S3 | API Gateway | Python | JavaScript

💡 Key Learning:
Serverless + event-driven = powerful automation without managing servers. Pay only for what you use, scale automatically.
